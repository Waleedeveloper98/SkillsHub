# SkillsHub – React Router Practice App

SkillsHub is a focused React project built to **practice and deeply understand React Router (v6+)** within one real application instead of multiple small demos.

The goal is to learn routing the way it is actually used in production apps.

---

## 🚀 What This Project Covers

- Basic routing
- Nested routes using `Outlet`
- Dynamic routes with `useParams`
- Nested dynamic routes
- Programmatic navigation with `useNavigate`
- Dashboard layout routing
- Global and nested 404 pages

---

## 🧩 Tech Stack

- **React (Vite)**
- **React Router DOM v6+**
- **JavaScript**

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The purpose of this project is to build a **strong mental model of React routing**, so the same concepts can be confidently applied to any real-world React application.

---

## 🧠 Key Learnings

- Routes inside `children` are relative
- `Outlet` is required for nested routes to render
- React Router matches **URLs**, not data
- Invalid dynamic routes must be handled manually
- `navigate(-1)` performs client-side navigation and does **not** reload the page

---

## 📌 Note

This project focuses purely on **routing logic and behavior**, not UI design or styling.  
The emphasis is on understanding how React Router works under the hood in real applications.
