SkillsHub – React Router Practice App

This is a simple React project created to practice and understand React Router (v6+) in one real application instead of multiple small projects.

What This Project Covers

✅Basic routing
✅Nested routes using Outlet
✅Dynamic routes with useParams
✅Nested dynamic routes
✅Programmatic navigation with useNavigate
✅Dashboard layout routing
✅Global and nested 404 pages


Tech Stack

React (Vite)
React Router DOM v6+
JavaScript


Purpose
The goal of this project is to build a strong understanding of React routing so the same concepts can be used in any real project.



Key Learning

Routes inside children are relative
Outlet is required for nested routes
React Router matches URLs, not data
Invalid dynamic routes must be handled manually
navigate(-1) does not reload the page


Note

This project focuses on learning routing logic, not UI design.
